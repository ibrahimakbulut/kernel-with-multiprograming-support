# kernel-with-multiprograming-support
Covers topics like interrupts, multi-programing and process that are very important terms in an operating system.

This is basic for writing our own operating system. Our operating system is run o a MIPS CPU. MIPS CPU will be simulated by the open source package SPIM.  http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/


After SPIM is downloaded, you will replace the syscall.cpp and syscall.h files with here, adding some new features and implementing a simple operating system.
